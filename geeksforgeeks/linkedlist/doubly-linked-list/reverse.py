# Reverse a Doubly Linked List
# (a) Original Doubly Linked List  


 

#      (b) Reversed Doubly Linked List  





# Here is a simple method for reversing a Doubly Linked List. All we need to do is swap prev and next pointers for all nodes, change prev of the head (or start) and change the head pointer in the end.

# A node of the doubly linked list

	# Constructor for empty Doubly Linked List
	def __init__(self):

		temp = None
		current = self.head

		# Swap next and prev for all nodes of
		# doubly linked list
		while current is not None:
			temp = current.prev
			current.prev = current.next
			current.next = temp
			current = current.prev

		# Before changing head, check for the cases like
		# empty list and list with only one node
		if temp is not None:
			self.head = temp.prev

	# Given a reference to the head of a list and an
	# integer,inserts a new node on the front of list
	def push(self, new_data):

		# 1. Allocates node
		# 2. Put the data in it
		new_node = Node(new_data)

		# 3. Make next of new node as head and
		# previous as None (already None)
		new_node.next = self.head

		# 4. change prev of head node to new_node
		if self.head is not None:
			self.head.prev = new_node

		# 5. move the head to point to the new node
		self.head = new_node

# Time Complexity: O(N), where N denotes the number of nodes in the doubly linked list.
# Auxiliary Space: O(1)
# We can also swap data instead of pointers to reverse the Doubly Linked List. Method used for reversing array can be used to swap data. Swapping data can be costly compared to pointers if the size of the data item(s) is more.
# Please write comments if you find any of the above codes/algorithms incorrect, or find better ways to solve the same problem.


# Method 2: 

# The same question can also be done by using Stacks. 

# Steps:

# Keep pushing the nodeâ€™s data in the stack. -> O(n)
# The keep popping the elements out and updating the Doubly Linked List
