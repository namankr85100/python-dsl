# A Doubly Linked List (DLL) contains an extra pointer, 
# typically called previous pointer, together with next pointer and data which are there in singly linked list.

# Node of a doubly linked list 
class Node:
	def __init__(self, next=None, prev=None, data=None):
		self.next = next # reference to next node in DLL
		self.prev = prev # reference to previous node in DLL
		self.data = data

# Following are advantages/disadvantages of doubly linked list over singly linked list.
# Advantages over singly linked list 
# 1) A DLL can be traversed in both forward and backward direction. 
# 2) The delete operation in DLL is more efficient if pointer to the node to be deleted is given. 
# 3) We can quickly insert a new node before a given node. 
# In singly linked list, to delete a node, pointer to the previous node is needed. To get this previous node, sometimes the list is traversed. In DLL, we can get the previous node using previous pointer. 
 

 
# Disadvantages over singly linked list 
# 1) Every node of DLL Require extra space for an previous pointer. It is possible to implement DLL with single pointer though (See this and this). 
# 2) All operations require an extra pointer previous to be maintained. For example, in insertion, we need to modify previous pointers together with next pointers. For example in following functions for insertions at different positions, we need 1 or 2 extra steps to set previous pointer.
# Insertion 
# A node can be added in four ways 
# 1) At the front of the DLL 
# 2) After a given node. 
# 3) At the end of the DLL 
# 4) Before a given node.

#  1) Add a node at the front: (A 5 steps process) 
# The new node is always added before the head of the given Linked List.
#  And newly added node becomes the new head of DLL. For example if the given Linked List is 10152025 and we add an item 5 at the front, 
#  then the Linked List becomes 510152025. Let us call the function that adds at the front of the list is push(). 
#  The push() must receive a pointer to the head pointer, because push must change the head pointer to point to the new node 

 # Adding a node at the front of the list
def push(self, new_data):

	# 1 & 2: Allocate the Node & Put in the data
	new_node = Node(data = new_data)

	# 3. Make next of new node as head and previous as NULL
	new_node.next = self.head
	new_node.prev = None

	# 4. change prev of head node to new node 
	if self.head is not None:
		self.head.prev = new_node

	# 5. move the head to point to the new node
	self.head = new_node 

# 2) Add a node after a given node.: (A 7 steps process) 
# We are given pointer to a node as prev_node, and the new node is inserted after the given node.

# Given a node as prev_node, insert
# a new node after the given node

def insertAfter(self, prev_node, new_data):

		# 1. check if the given prev_node is NULL
		if prev_node is None:
			print("This node doesn't exist in DLL")
			return

		#2. allocate node & 3. put in the data
		new_node = Node(data = new_data)

		# 4. Make next of new node as next of prev_node
		new_node.next = prev_node.next

		# 5. Make the next of prev_node as new_node 
		prev_node.next = new_node

		# 6. Make prev_node as previous of new_node
		new_node.prev = prev_node

		# 7. Change previous of new_node's next node */
		if new_node.next is not None:
			new_node.next.prev = new_node

# 3) Add a node at the end: (7 steps process) 
# The new node is always added after the last node of the given Linked List. For example if the given DLL is 510152025 and we add an item 30 at the end, then the DLL becomes 51015202530. 
# Since a Linked List is typically represented by the head of it, we have to traverse the list till end and then change the next of last node to new node.
             


# Add a node at the end of the DLL
def append(self, new_data):

		# 1. allocate node 2. put in the data
		new_node = Node(data = new_data)
		last = self.head

		# 3. This new node is going to be the 
		# last node, so make next of it as NULL
		new_node.next = None

		# 4. If the Linked List is empty, then
		# make the new node as head
		if self.head is None:
			new_node.prev = None
			self.head = new_node
			return

		# 5. Else traverse till the last node 
		while (last.next is not None):
			last = last.next

		# 6. Change the next of last node 
		last.next = new_node
		# 7. Make last node as previous of new node */
		new_node.prev = last


# Steps 
# Let the pointer to this given node be next_node and the data of the new node to be added as new_data. 
 

# Check if the next_node is NULL or not. If itâ€™s NULL, return from the function because any new node can not be added before a NULL
# Allocate memory for the new node, let it be called new_node
# Set new_node->data = new_data
# Set the previous pointer of this new_node as the previous node of the next_node, new_node->prev = next_node->prev
# Set the previous pointer of the next_node as the new_node, next_node->prev = new_node
# Set the next pointer of this new_node as the next_node, new_node->next = next_node;
# If the previous node of the new_node is not NULL, then set the next pointer of this previous node as new_node, new_node->prev->next = new_node
# Else, if the prev of new_node is NULL, it will be the new head node. So, make (*head_ref) = new_node.
