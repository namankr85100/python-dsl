# Method 1 (Divide the space in two halves)
# A simple way to implement two stacks is to divide the array in two halves and assign the half half space to two stacks, i.e., 
# # use arr[0] to arr[n/2] for stack1, and arr[(n/2) + 1] to arr[n-1] for stack2 where arr[] is the array to be used to implement two stacks and size of array be n.

# The problem with this method is inefficient use of array space.
#  A stack push operation may result in stack overflow even if there is space available in arr[].
#  For example, say the array size is 6 and we push 3 elements to stack1 and do not push anything to second stack2.
#  When we push 4th element to stack1, there will be overflow even if we have space for 3 more elements in array.

# Complexity Analysis:

# Push operation : O(1)
# Pop operation : O(1)
# Auxiliary Space: O(N).
# Use of array to implement stack so. It is not the space-optimised method as explained above.


# Method 2 (A space efficient implementation)
# This method efficiently utilizes the available space. 
# It doesnâ€™t cause an overflow if there is space available in arr[].
#  The idea is to start two stacks from two extreme corners of arr[].
#  stack1 starts from the leftmost element, the first element in stack1 is pushed at index 0.
#  The stack2 starts from the rightmost corner, the first element in stack2 is pushed at index (n-1).
#  Both stacks grow (or shrink) in opposite direction. To check for overflow, all we need to check is for space between top elements of both stacks.
#  This check is highlighted in the below code.
